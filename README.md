scala_monad_slides
==================
To run samples, [install sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html]) first
Then cd to project's directory and run `sbt run` command. It will download everything needed, compile and run sample program. Now you can start digging a code trying to understand what was shown in slides.
